Project Documentation: Predicting House Prices
Project Title: Predicting House Prices

Project Description:
In this project, I have built a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood. The goal of the project was to introduce regression analysis concepts and demonstrate the process of developing a predictive model.

Steps Implemented:
1. Data Collection:
Obtained the Amsterdam Housing Dataset containing information about house prices, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood.
2. Data Exploration:
Explored the dataset to understand its structure, checked for missing values, and gained insights into the distribution of house prices and features.
3. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding for neighborhoods).
4. Feature Selection:
Selected relevant features believed to have an impact on house prices, using correlation matrices and feature importance techniques for guidance.
5. Model Selection:
Chose a regression algorithm such as Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regression for the project.
6. Data Split:
Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set, typically using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
7. Model Training:
Trained the linear regression model on the training data, using selected features as input and house prices as the target variable and then trained the random forest regression model to improve the accuracy of the predictions of the model.
8. Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
9. Prediction:
Used the trained model to make house price predictions for new data points or hypothetical scenarios.
10. Visualization:
Created visualizations such as scatter plots or regression plots to visualize the relationships between individual features and house prices.
11. Model Tuning:
Experimented with different hyperparameters of the regression model to improve its predictive accuracy.
12. Documentation:
Documented the project, including the dataset source, preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation results, and insights gained. This documentation will help communicate findings and methods effectively.
13. Conclusion:
The project provided hands-on experience with regression analysis techniques and demonstrated the process of building a machine learning model for house price prediction. The trained model can be used to make accurate predictions and provide insights into factors influencing house prices.
